As well, not trying to fit into cute outfits because I may get cat called. My new challenged was to lose weight, I spent 4 years on dieting. With my supportive families they help me to cook and buy some healthy foods to eat. Now I'm in the Planet Fitness membership in order to train myself mentally. It was hard at first, but it was worth it. </p>

I got excited because I needed a job and I love food, so why not. I got ready, my clothing and my resume, and went with my sister to drop me off. My first step was to stay cool and calm because that was my family has told me. I went to the door to meet the staffs I was calm and they were nice. They intreview them and said they will send me a respond message from the email. </p>

          <p class="lead">I have a fear on heights, don't know why but I have a fear of cliffs and flying. I was in 8th grade and my class field trip was going into six flags. I have never gone into Six Flags and have never gone into roller coaster. I my classmates were pretty excited and I'm the only kid who doesn't want to go. One of them picked on me for being a chicken and I called him that I'm not a chickem. So I went to challenge my fear. The first rollercoaster that I went was the Viper. It has only in carts, I didn't like it. So I went to the popular ride the Superman. It was fun and like in fact that the seats where in bars and it lies you flat like Superman. I try to open my eyes to see and I once I've open I started screaming like a kid. lol  </p>
